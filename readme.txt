== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is Oxygen compatible with page builders?**
Yes. In addition to using Oxygen to design your entire site, you can use Oxygen in conjunction with popular page builders like Elementor or Beaver Builder. Design your site's headers, footers, and other templates with Oxygen, and design your inner page content using the page builder.

**Can I edit an existing theme with Oxygen?**
No. Oxygen is a visual replacement for your theme. Your theme no longer has any control over the design of your site. It is all controlled by Oxygen. To edit an existing theme, we recommend using a plugin like Microthemer.
